## 🚀 Current Highlighted Project

### [LangGuesser](https://langguesser.com/)
As a lover of languages, I was inspired by GeoGuessr to create LangGuesser. It's a game that challenges you to guess the country of origin by listening to a 15-second audio clip of a language or accent. Here's how it works:
- **Listen:** Enjoy a 15-second audio clip (some are shorter from the earlier development days, to be fixed).
- **Guess:** Click on the country on the map that you believe matches the accent.
- **Gameplay:** Tackle 10 rounds with a fresh audio clip each time.
- **Challenge:** Three wrong answers will eliminate you.
- **Scoring:** Earn points based on speed and accuracy, with consecutive correct answers boosting your multiplier.
- **Account:** Create an account to track your progress, view average scores, check out statistics, and see your last games played.
- **Compete:** Climb the leaderboard and see if you can secure a spot among the top 10 players worldwide!

You can play it solo, or 1v1 multiplayer against your friends or random people :)

## 🗣️ Languages

I'm a bit of a languages nerd! I'm fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, Galician, English, and Russian, and I'm also learning Chinese, Italian, French, Swedish, and German. 

Feel free to contact me in any of these languages :)
